** Current branch status **

* Dec 13 2020 - Development for 1.0 has slowed somewhat, only minor changes will be required for a 1.0 release, plus possibly SELinux profiles.  Current focus is on user feedback on features and functionality before an eventual 1.0 release.

* Jun 22 2021 - Some big plans for 1.2 involving a TOTP (Authenticator) 1.0 is basically done, but really there's a lack of users/testers to proceed, so please help if you can... otherwise 1.2 may ultimately be the first real release.

* Jul 07 2021 - Branched 1.0.x_release version, it's likely that most future development will be on 1.2.x and later, 1.0 has some issues with coding standards, and not all the code cleanup I would like has been completed, but it is fully functional and useful.
