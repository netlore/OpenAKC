** Current project status **

* Dec 13 2020 - Development for 1.0 has slowed somewhat, only minor changes will be required for a 1.0 release, plus possibly SELinux profiles.  Current focus is on user feedback on features and functionality before an eventual 1.0 release.

* Jun 22 2021 - Some big plans for 1.2 involving a TOTP (Authenticator) 1.0 is basically done, but really there's a lack of users/testers to proceed, so please help if you can... otherwise 1.2 may ultimately be the first real release.

* Jun 07 2021 - Start of work on new version of openakc tool that uses the new auth function instead of sudo/trust on a "jump host" - this will lead to a new version which greatly simplifies the system setup, and is the start of making OpenAKC fully independent of a "jump host".
